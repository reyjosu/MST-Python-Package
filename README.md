# MST Python Package by J.Reyes and C. Villafuerte Cardoso



Like Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's is also a Greedy algorithm.
It starts with an empty spanning tree and maitaining two sets of 
vertices. One set has all of those included by the MST, the other set
has veritces that were left out. Every iteration it considers all the edges 
and picks the edge with the least weight. This process repeates until all points are 
connected cautiously avoiding creating a cycle.
